# ðŸ¦Ÿ Mosquito Mod

A Minecraft Forge mod that introduces mosquitos as custom hostile mobs. This project involved working within the existing Minecraft codebase using the Forge modding framework, focusing on extending game functionality through entity creation, AI behavior, and integration with the game's world generation systems.

## Features

- Implements mosquitos as fully functional hostile entities
- Custom AI behavior and attack logic
- Integration with biome-based spawning systems
- Built using the Minecraft Forge API (1.8.9)

## Purpose

This project served as a deep dive into modifying and extending a large-scale, pre-existing codebase. It involved applying object-oriented programming principles, navigating obfuscated source code, and adhering to modding best practices while building new game features from scratch. It was also an opportunity to practice Java development in a complex, event-driven architecture.
